# iris-decision-tree-classifier

This project explores a supervised machine learning solution using the classic Iris dataset.  
I built a decision tree classifier using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn to predict flower species from petal and sepal measurements.  
This is part of my AI coursework for Purdue Global (IN400).


## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used (`iris.data.txt`) contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three species:
- Iris setosa
- Iris versicolor
- Iris virginica

## ⚙️ Features
- `sepal_length`
- `sepal_width`
- `petal_length`
- `petal_width`

## 🎯 Goal
Train a decision tree classifier to predict the species of an iris flower based on its measurements.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## 🔍 Accuracy
The model achieved **100% accuracy** on the test set in this implementation.
